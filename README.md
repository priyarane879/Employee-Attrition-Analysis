# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
The Employee Attrition Analysis and Performance Enhancement project aims to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and performance within an organization. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing up to 30 features—both categorical and discrete, encompassing numerical and textual data—the project seeks to uncover patterns and insights that can inform strategies to reduce attrition rates and enhance employee performance.

Project Objectives:

Attrition Analysis: Examine the dataset to identify primary factors contributing to employee attrition, such as job satisfaction, compensation, work-life balance, and career development opportunities.

Performance Evaluation: Assess the relationship between various factors and employee performance ratings to determine key drivers of high performance.

Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast employee attrition, enabling proactive interventions to retain valuable talent.

Correlation Analysis: Calculate and interpret correlations between different variables to understand their impact on attrition and performance.

Methodology:

Data Collection and Preparation: Gather and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data to ensure consistency and reliability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to visualize distributions, identify outliers, and uncover initial patterns in the data.


Expected Outcomes:

Identification of Attrition Drivers: A comprehensive list of factors most strongly associated with employee turnover.

Performance Enhancement Strategies: Recommendations for initiatives to improve employee performance based on identified key factors.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can lead to a more stable and high-performing workforce, ultimately contributing to the organization's overall success.
